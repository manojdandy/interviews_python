       "\"\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of India. Let me think. I remember that India's capital isn't Mumbai, even though Mumbai is a major city. Wait, isn't it New Delhi? But sometimes people get confused between Delhi and New Delhi. Let me confirm. Yes, the capital is New Delhi. But I should explain the difference briefly. Delhi is the larger National Capital Territory, and New Delhi is a part of it, designated as the capital. So the answer should state New Delhi as the capital and maybe clarify that distinction to avoid confusion. Also, check if there's any recent change, but I don't think so. Yeah, that's right. So the answer is New Delhi.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of India is **New Delhi**. \\n\\nNew Delhi serves as the administrative and political center of the country and is part of the larger National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. It was officially designated as the capital in 1911 during British rule and remains the capital today.\""
