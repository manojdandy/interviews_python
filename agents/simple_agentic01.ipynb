       "   'content': 'Stateful Graph: LangGraph revolves around the concept of a stateful graph, where each node in the graph represents a step in your computation, and the graph maintains a state that is passed around and updated as the computation progresses. LangGraph supports conditional edges, allowing you to dynamically determine the next node to execute based on the current state of the graph. We define nodes for classifying the input, handling greetings, and handling search queries. def classify_input_node(state): LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects. Remember to pay attention to state management, conditional edges, and ensuring there are no dead-end nodes in your graph.',\n",

Just as a messaging app ensures all interactions (messages) follow a consistent format, the schema in LangGraph ensures the state passed along edges is structured and interpretable. This static schema allows nodes to rely on a consistent state format, ensuring seamless communication along edges throughout the graph. In this article, we explored the foundational concepts of graph-based systems, drawing parallels to familiar messaging applications to illustrate how edges, nodes, and state transitions function seamlessly in dynamic workflows.',\n",
