      "Okay, the user is asking \"what is capital of india\". Let me start by recalling that the capital of India is New Delhi. But wait, sometimes people might confuse it with Delhi as a whole, so I should make sure to specify New Delhi.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about possible variations. Is there any chance the user is referring to something else? Maybe a historical capital? No, the current capital has been New Delhi since it was established in 1911, replacing Kolkata. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, when was New Delhi officially declared the capital? Let me confirm the timeline. The British Raj moved the capital from Calcutta (Kolkata) to Delhi, and New Delhi was built as the administrative center. It was inaugurated in 1931, but the capital status was formalized then. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should check if there's any recent change, but I don't think so. The capital remains New Delhi. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user might be a student needing this for a quiz or just general knowledge. They might also appreciate a bit more context, like why it's New Delhi and not just Delhi. Maybe mention that Delhi is a larger metropolitan area, and New Delhi is a part of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the user made a typo, but \"India\" is clear. No other country's capital is being asked here. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer should be straightforward: New Delhi. But to be thorough, I can also mention a bit of history or the distinction between Delhi and New Delhi. However, since the question is direct, keeping it concise would be better. \n",
      "\n",
      "No, I think the user just wants the correct answer. I should also make sure there's no confusion with other countries. For example, sometimes people confuse India's capital with Mumbai because it's a major city, but that's not correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "Double-checking reliable sources in my mind: yes, New Delhi is the capital. Alright, I can confidently state that.\n",

New Delhi is a distinct area within the larger National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi and houses important government buildings, including the Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's residence), and the Supreme Court of India. \n",
      "\n",

      "First, Delhi is a metropolitan area, and within that, New Delhi is the part that serves as the capital. So the official capital is New Delhi. But maybe I should explain the difference to avoid confusion. \n",

      "Let me verify this. India gained independence from British rule in 1947, and New Delhi has been the capital since 1911 when the British announced the shift from Kolkata (then Calcutta). Yes, that's right. So the answer should be New Delhi. \n",

      "I should also mention that New Delhi is a part of the larger National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. But the user might just need the straightforward answer. However, providing a bit more context could be helpful. \n",

      "Wait, is there any chance that someone might think it's Mumbai or Kolkata? Kolkata was the capital before 1911, and Mumbai (Bombay) was the capital of Bombay State but not the national capital. So I should clarify that to prevent confusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user might be a student or someone looking for quick facts. Keeping it concise yet informative is key. Let me structure the answer: state the capital, explain the shift from Kolkata, mention the NCT, and note the historical context. \n",

      "Double-checking sources in my mind: yes, Government of India websites and official documents all refer to New Delhi as the capital. No conflicting information there. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer is clear: New Delhi is the capital of India. But adding a sentence about the historical background would make the answer more complete. Alright, I think that's all. Just need to present it clearly without any errors.\n",

      "I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c = 0, then (0)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac), so 0 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Therefore, rearranged, a² + b² + c² = -2(ab + bc + ac). \n",

      "\n",
      "From (a + b + c)^2 =0, so a² + b² + c² = -2(ab + bc + ac). Let me denote S = a + b + c =0, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc (though maybe P isn't needed here). \n",

      "Alternatively, if a movie must have a director, then NOT NULL, else allow NULL. Since the question doesn't specify, maybe just not null unless specified. But perhaps it's better to allow it to be nullable in case of missing data. Hmm, but in a design, it's better to enforce it if possible. Maybe set it as NOT NULL with a default director? Not sure. Let's leave it as optional for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the data types need to be appropriate. For example, release_year as YEAR, which is a valid type, or perhaps an INT. Title as VARCHAR(255) should be okay. Rental_price as DECIMAL for currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the Actors table, birth_date is a DATE? Or YEAR? The user didn't specify, but using DATE gives more precision. Alternatively, just birth_year if only year is needed. Let's go with DATE for birth_date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly for directors, birth_year could be a YEAR type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, check for relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Each movie has one director (assuming one-to-many between directors and movies). If that's not the case, then need a junction table between directors and movies. The user didn't mention a many-to-many for directors, so perhaps it's one-to-many, so director_id in movies is okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to be thorough, maybe clarify. Since the user mentioned many-to-many for actors and genres, but not for directors, so I'll proceed with director_id in Movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe it's better to make it a many-to-many, just in case. Let me think again. The user only specified actors and genres as many-to-many. So the user probably expects directors to be one-to-many. So proceed with director_id in Movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the primary keys: all tables have their own surrogate keys (movie_id, actor_id, etc.), which is standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, is there a possibility of circular dependencies? Probably not here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me structure all the CREATE TABLE statements properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in the junction tables like Actor_Movie, do we need any additional columns? Like the role of the actor in the movie. The user didn't mention that, so perhaps not needed. Just the links.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the Movie_Genre just links movies to genres.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers it. Let me write them out step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, also, foreign keys need to reference the correct columns. So in Actor_Movie, the foreign keys reference actor_id from Actors and movie_id from Movies. Same for Movie_Genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about indexes? Not sure if needed, but maybe those junction tables can have indexes on both foreign keys for performance. But the question is about schema, so maybe not required to mention indexes unless specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Movies table: primary key movie_id, title, release_year, director_id (FK), rental_price, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps include other fields like duration, rating, etc., but the user didn't specify, so minimal columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's check the user's exact requirements again. They mentioned \"includes tables for actors, directors, genres, and movies. It should also have a many-to-many relationship between actors and movies, and between movies and genres.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the core is those four tables plus the junctions for actors-movies and movies-genres. Directors are a one-to-many with movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so the tables are as above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the director can have multiple movies, so the director's ID in movies is a foreign key to directors. That works.\n",
